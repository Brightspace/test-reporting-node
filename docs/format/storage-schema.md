# Storage Schema

All report data once submitted to the back-end is stored in [AWS Timestream].
The data is split across 2 tables ([`summary`](#summary) and
[`details`](#details)) to better store common items, reduce duplication and
allow for more targeted queries. Below is a breakdown of the various tables and
their columns as well as the corresponding JSON path within the report format
the data is sourced from. The current `measure_name` for both the
[`summary`](#summary) and [`details`](#details) tables is `report_v3_bc` — the
`_bc` suffix indicates the `details` records still carry deprecated dimensions
(`experience`, `type`, `tool`, `timeout`) for backwards compatibility. Once
those dimensions are removed the suffix will be dropped to `report_v3` on both
tables. Old format records will be marked with `report_v2`, `report_v2_bc` or
`*_test_run` and can require special handling. See notes under various
**Removed** sections for details.

> [!NOTE]
  The storage schema is always based on the [latest report schema] and uses the
  [auto upgrading report construct] to make sure it's always the latest schema.

## Tables

### `summary`

This table contains all of the information that is common to a test run as well
as some rolled up counts of various test statuses.

#### Timestamp

* `time` (`TIMESTAMP`): Stored with **millisecond** precision, sourced from
  report JSON `report.summary.started`.

#### Measures

* `duration_total` (`BIGINT`): Stored as **milliseconds** from report JSON
  `report.summary.duration.total`.
* `status` (`VARCHAR`): Will either be `passed` or `failed`, sourced from report
  JSON `report.summary.status`.
* `count_passed` (`BIGINT`): Sourced from report JSON
  `report.summary.count.passed`.
* `count_failed` (`BIGINT`): Sourced from report JSON
  `report.summary.count.failed`.
* `count_skipped` (`BIGINT`): Sourced from report JSON
  `report.summary.count.skipped`.
* `count_flaky` (`BIGINT`): Sourced from report JSON
  `report.summary.count.flaky`.

> [!WARNING]
  Anything marked with **[deprecated]** should be moved away from. Sending of
  this column will be removed in the near future.

##### Removed

* `total_duration` (`BIGINT`): Starting with records that have `measure_name` of
  `report_v2` this field will no longer be present. Please use `duration_total`
  instead. If wanting to get data from records prior to `report_v2` please use
  `COALESCE(total_duration, duration_total)` to get a reasonable value.

#### Dimensions

> [!NOTE]
  All dimensions are stored as `VARCHAR` as it is the only format available.

* `report_id`: Sourced from report JSON `report.id`.
* `github_organization`: Sourced from report JSON
  `report.summary.github.organization`.
* `github_repository`: Sourced from report JSON
  `report.summary.github.repository`.
* `github_workflow`: Sourced from report JSON `report.summary.github.workflow`.
* `github_run_id`: Sourced from report JSON `report.summary.github.runId`.
* `github_run_attempt`: Sourced from report JSON
  `report.summary.github.runAttempt`.
* `git_branch`: Sourced from report JSON `report.summary.git.branch`.
* `git_sha`: Sourced from report JSON `report.summary.git.sha`.
* `operating_system`: Will be one of `windows`, `linux` or `mac`, sourced from
  report JSON `report.summary.operatingSystem`.
* `framework`: Sourced from report JSON `report.summary.framework`.
* `lms_build_number` (`NULLABLE`): Sourced from report JSON
  `report.summary.lms.buildNumber`.
* `lms_instance_url` (`NULLABLE`): Sourced from report JSON
  `report.summary.lms.instanceUrl`.

> [!WARNING]
  Anything marked with **[deprecated]** should be moved away from. Sending of
  this column will be removed in the near future.

### `details`

This table contains information about each individual test that was run. You can
map to the [`summary`](#summary) data via the `report_id` if you need a
combination of the data.

#### Timestamp

* `time` (`TIMESTAMP`): Stored with **millisecond** precision, sourced from
  report JSON `report.details[].started`.

#### Measures

* `duration_final` (`BIGINT`): Stored as **milliseconds**, sourced from report
  JSON `report.details[].duration.final`.
* `duration_total` (`BIGINT`): Stored as **milliseconds**, sourced from report
  JSON `report.details[].duration.total`.
* `retries` (`BIGINT`): Sourced from report JSON `report.details[].retries`.
* `status` (`VARCHAR`): Will be one of `passed`, `skipped` or `failed`, sourced
  from report JSON `report.details[].status`.
* `configuration_timeout` (`BIGINT`, `NULLABLE`): Stored as **milliseconds**, sourced
  from report JSON `report.details[].configuration.timeout`.

> [!WARNING]
  Anything marked with **[deprecated]** should be moved away from. Sending of
  this column will be removed in the near future.

##### Removed

* `duration` (`BIGINT`): Starting with records that have `measure_name` of
  `report_v2` this field will no longer be present. Please use `duration_final`
  instead. If wanting to get data from records prior to `report_v2` please use
  `COALESCE(duration, duration_final)` to get a reasonable value.
* `total_duration` (`BIGINT`): Starting with records that have `measure_name` of
  `report_v2` this field will no longer be present. Please use `duration_total`
  instead. If wanting to get data from records prior to `report_v2` please use
  `COALESCE(total_duration, duration_total)` to get a reasonable value.

#### Dimensions

> [!NOTE]
  All dimensions are stored as `VARCHAR` as it is the only format available.

* `report_id`: Sourced from report JSON `report.id`.
* `name`: Sourced from report JSON `report.details[].name`.
* `location_file`: Sourced from report JSON `report.details[].location.file`.
* `location_line` (`NULLABLE`): Sourced from report JSON
  `report.details[].location.line`.
* `location_column` (`NULLABLE`): Sourced from report JSON
  `report.details[].location.column`.
* `browser` (`NULLABLE`): Can be one of `chrome`, `chromium`, `firefox`,
  `webkit`, `safari` or `edge`, sourced from report JSON
  `report.details[].browser`.
* `github_codeowners` (`NULLABLE`): A comma-separated list sourced from report
  JSON `report.details[].github.codeowners`.
* `type` (`NULLABLE`) **[deprecated]**: Replaced by `taxonomy_type`. Sourced
  from report JSON `report.details[].taxonomy.type`.
* `taxonomy_type` (`NULLABLE`): Sourced from report JSON
  `report.details[].taxonomy.type`.
* `experience` (`NULLABLE`) **[deprecated]**: No longer part of the report
  schema starting with v3. For v1/v2 reports this is sourced from the original
  JSON at `report.details[].experience` before upgrade and injected onto the
  outgoing record. Records without this dimension will appear once the source
  reports are exclusively v3 or newer.
* `tool` (`NULLABLE`) **[deprecated]**: Replaced by `taxonomy_tool`. Sourced
  from report JSON `report.details[].taxonomy.tool`.
* `taxonomy_tool` (`NULLABLE`): Sourced from report JSON
  `report.details[].taxonomy.tool`.
* `timeout` (`NULLABLE`) **[deprecated]**: Replaced by the `configuration_timeout`
  measure. Stored as **milliseconds**, sourced from report JSON
  `report.details[].configuration.timeout`.

> [!WARNING]
  Anything marked with **[deprecated]** should be moved away from. Sending of
  this column will be removed in the near future.

##### Removed

* `location`: Starting with records that have `measure_name` of `report_v2` this
  field will no longer be present. Please use `location_file` instead. If
  wanting to get data from records prior to `report_v2` please use
  `COALESCE(location, location_file)` to get a reasonable value.
